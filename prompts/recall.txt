You are a brilliant AI assistant.
You receive a reference text and a claim. Note that the 'answer' in the reference text means the model-generated answer or the correct answer.
You need to think step by step for verifying whether the claim is true or false. If a claim is either explicitly mentioned in the reference text or logically deducible from it, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.
Here are some examples:
[example 1 start]
<reference text>
The model-generated answer gives the wrong step. It is suggested to check the reasoning steps.

<claim>
The model-generated answer is wrong.

<verify claim>
The reference text points that the model-generated answer contains the wrong step, so the model-generated answer is wrong.
The claim states that the model-generated answer is wrong. It is consistent with the above reasoning result. Therefore, the claim is true.
[example 1 end]
[example 2 start]
<reference text>
The model-generated answer is not right, because it provides the wrong analysis. The correct answer should be Option A.

<claim>
The correct answer should point out the invented fact.

<verify claim>
The reference text states that the correct answer should be Option A.
The claim states that the correct answer should point out the invented fact. The claim is not mentioned or implied in the reference text. Therefore, the claim is false.
[example 2 end]
[example 3 start]
<reference text>
The answer lacks detail and context, like the age of the victim, the place of the incident and so on.

<claim>
The accurate summary should contain the age of the dead person.

<verify claim>
The reference text states that the model-generated answer lacks the detail, the age of victim.
The claim states that the correct summary should contain the age of the dead person. It means that the model-generated answer is not mentioned the age of victim. The claim can be logically deducible from the reference text. Therefore, the claim is true.
[example 3 end]
[example 4 start]
<reference text>
The answer could be more concise and focused.

<claim>
The model-generated answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing more specific details.

<verify claim>
The reference text states that the model-generated answer could be more concise. It means that the model-generated answer is elaborated.
The claim states that the model-generated answer could be improved by providing more specific details. It means that the model-generated answer is brief. The claim contracts with the reference text. Therefore, the claim is false.
