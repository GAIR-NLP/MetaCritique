However, if your linoleum has begun to look dull or scratched, you might consider refinishing it instead of replacing it altogether. Here\u2019s how:\n\n## Prepare the surface\n\n1. Sweep and mop the floor. Before beginning any type of refinishing project, it\u2019s important to start with a clean slate (or floor). Use a broom to sweep up any loose dust or debris.

There are several ways to remove old floor finishes including sanding, scraping, and chemical strippers. Choose whichever method is most practical given the amount of time and money you\u2019re willing to spend. Once you\u2019ve removed the old finish, wash the floor again with soap and water. Allow it to dry completely.\n3. Sand the floor lightly with fine-grit sandpaper. Using light pressure, run the sandpaper over the entire floor until it becomes smooth to the touch. This process helps create a rough texture on the linoleum, giving the sealant something to grab onto. Don\u2019t use too much force while sanding, though; otherwise, you could damage the underlying surface. After sanding, vacuum up the dust and rinse the floor with warm water. Dry the floor completely before proceeding.\n4. Prime the floor with a latex concrete primer. Most paint stores sell special primers designed specifically for concrete surfaces.

So by looking at the spectrum of a star we can determine what elements it contains. By far the most common elements found in stars are H and He; all other elements are significantly less abundant.\nThe reason why different elements exist at all is because they were created inside stars. H and He were produced in the Big Bang, but heavy elements like oxygen or iron cannot be formed in ordinary stellar nucleosynthesis, they require fusion reactions that happen only in very massive stars (more than about eight times the mass of the Sun), which live fast and die young.

For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks.
