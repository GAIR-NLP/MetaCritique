It\u2019s commonly found on kitchen floors, but it also works well in bathrooms, laundry rooms, mudrooms, basements, and entryways.\n\nProperly maintained linoleum will last anywhere between 20-40 years. However, if your linoleum has begun to look dull or scratched, you might consider refinishing it instead of replacing it altogether. Here\u2019s how:\n\n## Prepare the surface\n\n1. Sweep and mop the floor. Before beginning any type of refinishing project, it\u2019s important to start with a clean slate (or floor). Use a broom to sweep up any loose dust or debris. Then, mop the entire area using hot water and a good quality floor cleaner. Allow the floor to dry completely. If you don\u2019t allow the floor to dry thoroughly, the sealer won\u2019t adhere properly.\n2. Remove any existing wax or finish. You should always remove any previous coatings before applying a fresh layer of finish. Otherwise, the new coating won\u2019t adhere correctly, and it will eventually peel up and leave behind a sticky residue. There are several ways to remove old floor finishes including sanding, scraping, and chemical strippers. Choose whichever method is most practical given the amount of time and money you\u2019re willing to spend. Once you\u2019ve removed the old finish, wash the floor again with soap and water. Allow it to dry completely.\n3. Sand the floor lightly with fine-grit sandpaper. Using light pressure, run the sandpaper over the entire floor until it becomes smooth to the touch. This process helps create a rough texture on the linoleum, giving the sealant something to grab onto. Don\u2019t use too much force while sanding, though; otherwise, you could damage the underlying surface. After sanding, vacuum up the dust and rinse the floor with warm water. Dry the floor completely before proceeding.\n4. Prime the floor with a latex concrete primer. Most paint stores sell special primers designed specifically for concrete surfaces.

The victim said she was sexually assaulted by a male patient at the West Suffolk Hospital in January last year.

The victim, not named for legal reasons, was admitted to the unit in Bury St Edmunds after an overdose. According to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), a review into the incident found a member of staff recorded that the assault had not happened because the male patient in the next door cubicle was under constant observation and had not left his bed.  This was found to be incorrect, it said. The victim said she reported the incident to the hospital and the police, but it was not escalated until she contacted the trust to complain.  She told HSJ she was left \"shocked, confused and furious\" over the way hospital staff had dealt with it. Dr Paul Molyneux, interim medical director at West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, said they were \"very sorry for the distressing experience\" the patient had while in their care. \"We know that the support given at the time could and should have been better,\" he said.

Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.\nWhile household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market. The company's \"Oshbot\" robot is built to assist customers in a store, which can help the customers find items and help guide them to the product's location in the store. It can also speak different languages and make recommendations for different items based on what the customer is shopping for.\nThe more interaction the robot has with humans, the more it learns. But Oshbot, like other social robots, is not intended to replace workers, but to work alongside other employees. \"We have technologies to train social robots to do things not for us, but with us,\" said Breazeal.\n\nQuestion: How are social robots different from household robots?\nOptions: (A) They can control their emotions; (B) They are more like humans; (C) They do the normal housework; (D) They respond to users more slowly.\nChoose the best option and justify your option.\n", "response": "The correct answer is A: They can control their emotions. \nSocial robots are designed to be more human-like in their behavior.
