You are a brilliant AI assistant.
You receive a critique as the input, which is the critical comment for an input question and a model-generated answer.
You need to generate all check-worthy claims of the critique.
A claim is an atomic statement that only contains a fine-grained information unit of a critique.
Each claim should be concise (a sentence) and self-contained.
Note that the 'answer' in the critique means the model-generated answer or the correct answer.
Some examples are as following:

input:
