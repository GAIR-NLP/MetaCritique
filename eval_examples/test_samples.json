    "question": "Before buying a house, what should I look for concerning my job?\n\nHere are the options:\nOption 1: make home\nOption 2: security\nOption 3: measureing distances\nOption 4: examining poorch\nOption 5: make money\n\nPlease choose the correct option and justify your choice:",
    "response": "Before buying a house, it's important to consider how the location of your new home will affect your commute to work. A long commute can negatively impact your quality of life, so you want to make sure that you choose a home that is relatively close to your place of employment. Additionally, you should also take into account potential future changes to your job. For example, if there is a possibility that you might need to travel more for work, you would want to choose a home that allows you to easily access major roads and highways. Another factor to consider is whether or not your company plans to move to a new location in the near future. If this is the case, you may want to think twice about purchasing a home that is very close to your current office, as your commute could significantly increase in the next few years. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, but I recommend evaluating how your new home will affect your commute to work before finalizing the purchase.",
    "hypothesis_critique": "The answer is well-written and provides good advice for someone considering buying a house. However, it does not directly address the options presented in the instruction. The instruction asks for what to look for concerning one's job, and the answer discusses the importance of considering the commute to work. While this is certainly relevant, it does not directly address the options presented.",
    "reference_answer": "Option 2: Security\n\nJustification: Before buying a house, it's crucial to consider the stability and security of your job. This is because purchasing a house is a significant financial commitment that often involves a mortgage, which requires a steady income to repay. If your job is not secure, you may face difficulties in meeting your mortgage payments, which could lead to financial stress or even loss of the house. Therefore, ensuring job security is a critical factor to consider before buying a house.",

      "critique": "The model-generated answer is comprehensive and provides a detailed response to the question. However, it doesn't directly address the options provided in the question. The critique here is that the model should have chosen one of the options and justified its choice as per the question's requirement. For instance, 'Option 3: measuring distances' could be a suitable choice as it aligns with the discussion about commute. The model should be programmed to follow the specific format of the question and provide a direct answer.",
